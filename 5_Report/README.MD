  This Mini Project in C is used to give overall cafeteria rating based on rating given 40 students.

  The rating given by the students should be on the scale of 1 to 10.

# Requirements:

  ● Operating System that supports execution of C-Program.

  ● A suitable IDE of C program that accepts data from the Student (Code Blocks is used)

  ● Header Files Required: 
    
    <stdio.h> (Standard input-output header) : Used to perform input and output operations in C. 
    
    <stdlib.h> (Standard library header) : Perform standard utility functions.
    
    <stdarg.h>  is a header in the C standard library of the C programming language that allows functions to accept an indefinite number of arguments.

# Test Plan:

Survey is prepared and circulated among the students to analyse the quality of cafeteria on the scale of 1 to 10. In this project overall rating is given by the students by considering the below questions

1)Opinion about pricing 

2)Opinion about service

3)Opinion about quality

4)Opinion about hygiene

5)Opinion about taste

Responses are taken from the 40 students, based on these responses the cafeteria rating is given.

Here the 40 students are asked to enter overall rating of the cafeteria, on a scale of 1 to 10;

where 1 means Disgusting and 10 means Excellent.
