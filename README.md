# Cafeteria Rating System
Rating is the common term where we come across daily. It is an evolution of the quality of something on a given scale from 1 to 10 or 1 to 5.
Often, rating is displayed by stars. The questions in rating are as follows “How would you rate our service?”.
It helps others to know about the thing either service/product is good or bad.

While giving ratings, it is highly recommended to give your real opinion because if you write bad reviews without knowing that will affect others.
